Would you like me to help you organize image filenames and folder structure (e.g., /images/programs/, /images/about/) and reference them directly in your HTML for SEO and performance?


Excellent idea ✅ — adding metadata (SEO tags, Open Graph, and accessibility tags) will help your Nurse Training Academy website rank better on Google and look professional when shared on social media.

Below, I’ll show you optimized metadata for each HTML file — you can paste it inside the <head> section below the <title> tag.

⚙️ General SEO & Accessibility Tips

Add alt text to all <img> tags — e.g.

<img src="images/cna.jpg" alt="Indian nursing student caring for patient during CNA training">


Use semantic HTML tags (<header>, <main>, <footer>, <section>) for better Google indexing.

Add structured data (schema.org) if you want to boost local SEO — e.g., Organization, LocalBusiness, or EducationalOrganization.

Compress your images (.webp preferred) to improve load speed.

Include a favicon:

<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="images/favicon.png">


Would you like me to include a schema markup (JSON-LD) snippet for your homepage — describing your academy as a recognized educational organization for Google Search?
(It improves visibility in search results and adds credibility.)
